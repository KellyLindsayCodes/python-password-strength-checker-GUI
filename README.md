Project Scope - The scope of the project was to learn Python - this is an updated version of my original project linked here -
https://github.com/KellyLindsayCodes/password-strength-checker -
The purpose of this project was to practice def functions, which I have used to remove the lists I made in the previous version. 
I have also added in a tkinter GUI to show that I can integrate an import library.
